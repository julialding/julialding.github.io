                <p class="text-faded">Hello! I'm a high school sophomore interested in all things STEM, more specifically computer science and mathematics.</p>
                <p class="text-faded">I love promoting computer science  ðŸ’» to the community â€” in fact, one of the causes I'm most
                    passionate about is empowering women and non-binary individuals in the fields of STEM, in hopes of bridging the gender gap.
                    I also love to get involved in the community â€” I'm currently one of sixteen elected student council officers school-wide, among many other things.
                </p>
                <p class="text-faded">In my free time, I enjoy playing the cello, puzzling out fun math problems, and (attempting) to play tennis!</p>
